# Saaf Hawa (Clean Air)

Saaf Hawa is a comprehensive Next.js web application designed to provide real-time air quality information, personalized health recommendations, and a suite of tools to promote environmental awareness and action. It's built with a focus on users in Pakistan, with an initial focus on Lahore.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: A comprehensive overview of the current Air Quality Index (AQI) for your location, with a detailed breakdown of major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, etc.) and an AI-generated weekly insight comparing current vs. past data.
- **Hazard Map**: A live, interactive map displaying toggleable layers for various real-time environmental hazards, including:
    - Wildfire data from NASA FIRMS.
    - Air quality monitoring stations from OpenAQ.
    - Weather overlays (temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds) from OpenWeatherMap.
- **AI Hazard Agent**: An intelligent, conversational AI agent that can be queried about environmental hazards in any location. The agent uses a combination of web search and live data APIs to provide detailed summaries and sources.
- **Personalized Health Advice**: Get AI-driven health recommendations tailored to your personal health profile (age, respiratory conditions, etc.) and the current air quality in your area.
- **Health Journal**: Track your daily symptoms (like coughing or headaches) and see how they correlate with local air quality, helping you understand the personal health impact of pollution.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: An interactive tool to estimate your annual carbon footprint based on your lifestyle (transport, energy use, diet, waste). It tracks your reduction progress over time and provides AI-powered tips.
- **Eco-Challenges & Leaderboard**: Participate in environmental challenges (e.g., "Green Commuter," "Waste Warrior"), earn points and badges for positive actions, and see how you rank against others in the community leaderboard.
- **Educational Content**: Access AI-curated articles on key environmental topics like pollution reduction, climate change, and sustainable living to stay informed and empowered.
- **User Profile Management**: A dedicated section for users to manage their profile information.
