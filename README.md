## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/saaf-hawa.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

4.  Set up your Firebase credentials by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project. This is needed for Genkit AI flows and Firestore to work. You can get these from your Firebase project settings.

### Running the Development Server

You need to run two separate processes for the application and the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Genkit server**:
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development server, which runs your AI flows.

2.  **Start the Next.js application**:
    In a separate terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
