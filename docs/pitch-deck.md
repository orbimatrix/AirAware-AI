### Slide 2: The Problem - A National Health Crisis

**Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis.**

- **Toxic Air:** Cities like Lahore and Karachi are consistently ranked among the world's most polluted, with AQI levels frequently reaching "Hazardous" levels.

- **Information Gap:** Citizens lack access to reliable, real-time, and localized air quality data. Without this information, they cannot take simple, protective measures for themselves and their families.
