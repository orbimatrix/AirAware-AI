## Core Features:

- Real-Time AQI Monitoring: Fetch and display current Air Quality Index data from the World Air Quality Index project API, Pakistan EPA, and local municipal systems.
- Localized Air Quality Display: Show PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, NO₂, and O₃ levels specific to the user's location using geolocation services.
- Hazard Zone Detection: Use a tool to identify and highlight high-pollution "red zones" based on air quality data. This AI feature reasons when air quality is too poor and recommends to the user a nearby alternative area, by cross-referencing location and air quality data.

An AI tool decides whether it should alert user based on environment conditions. If it decides it is appropriate, a specific recommendation from our database will be made based on user and situation.
